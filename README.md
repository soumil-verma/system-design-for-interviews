## 📌 Why This Repository?

System Design is not about memorizing diagrams — it’s about **thinking at scale**.

This repo is my **personal learning journal + interview prep playbook**, where I:
- Learn system design **from scratch**
- Break concepts into **clear mental models**
- Practice **real interview-style problems**
- Build **intuition**, not just notes

🎯 **Goal:** Become confident enough to design systems on a whiteboard under pressure.
